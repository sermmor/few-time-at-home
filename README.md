# FewTime@Home
The main idea of this project is tools to connect with home when you spend a lot of time out of home. So the backend can be you PC at home, and the front or Telegram Bot are your mobile, tablet or latop. So you can be secure using the Telegram Bot to communicate with home or using the front to create a local copy that when you arrive to home will be syncronized.
